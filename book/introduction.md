Welcome to the CREATOR documentation!

[CREATOR](https://creatorsim.github.io/) is a didactic and generic assembly programming simulator that provides a user-friendly environment for writing, assembling, and simulating assembly code. It supports various architectures, including [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/), [MIPS](https://mips.com/), and [Z80](https://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf), and allows users to define custom architectures. It is available as both a web-based application and a command-line interface (CLI) tool.
